# Day 8 – Java Backend Journey 

##  Concepts Learned
- **ExecutorService** → manage thread pools for tasks.
- **Parallel Streams** → auto parallel execution on collections.
- **Bank App Concurrency** → synchronized deposits/withdrawals.

## Programs Written
1. ExecutorDemo.java → Thread pool with 3 threads.
2. ParallelStreamDemo.java → Sum of squares in parallel.

##  Project Update
- **Bank CLI App**
  - Added multithreaded transactions (concurrent deposits & withdrawals).

## DSA Problems Solved
1. Gas Station(Greedy).
