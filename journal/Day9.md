# Day 9 – Java Backend Journey 

##  Concepts Learned
- Java File Handling:
  - FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter.
  - Read/write text files.
  - Exception handling with try-with-resources.

##  Programs Written
1. FilCreation.java → created file
1. FileWriteDemo.java → created and wrote to file.
2. FileReadDemo.java → read file line by line.

##  DSA Problem (Pattern: Binary Search)
- **Problem**: Search in Rotated Sorted Array.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Sorted + rotated → binary search on halves.
- **Status**: Implemented in `SearchInRotatedSortedArray.java`.
